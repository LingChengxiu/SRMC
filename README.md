Investigates sensitivity of risk measures including Value-at-Risk, expected-shortfall and expectile-quantile transformation level  in the framework of Huber (1964), i.e., considerting the underlying model is in an epsilon-neighborhood  of the pre-supposed ideal model. Obtains approximations of these tail-related risk measures based on the pre-supposed ideal model and its heavy contamination model, which are determined by the heaviness of the contamination model and its contaminaiton level. Illustrates also the influence function of the risk measures involved in the presence of infintestimal contamination. Gives typical examples including the normal, Laplace and Power-like contaminations and the numerical study as well. Applies theoretical approximations into the benchmark cryptocurrency market index, that is the CRIX. Finds out the heavier tendency of the recent CRIX.
